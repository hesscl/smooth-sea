### About

The goal of this research is to understand the dynamics of Seattle neighborhoods' median rent level using scraped rental housing listings from Craigslist. I use a series of data visualizations to describe the accumulated data and compare the Craigslist estimates against other indicators. After the data description, I model a panel of quarterly census tract estimates to explain the spatial and temporal dynamics observed so far. Models are trained on quarterly tract estimates observed through the prior quarter and forecast the current quarter's rent surface.
